## Purpose
This project turns any text file into an image file (preferrably .ppm) which can then be converted into a .bmp using ImageMagick.

Download for ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

## Precautions
Ensure that the .bmp file is a 24-bit bitmap as any other bit-size will cause text to become garble upon opening in a text editor.
Also ensure that the text editor encodes the .bmp text in UTF-8 to avoid errors with certain characters.
